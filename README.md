# GenA_Finder
Script done for my thesis.

Version 2.
This translates and compares assembled genomes in fasta format to the selected database.
Default is blastp, but you can use vsearch for a quicker search.
The Script can also sort the possible markers and give as an output a file with the sequences in order and only with a header with the corresponding input file name.


#Databases
  -Housekeeping Genes according to Gil 2004.
  
  -Housekeeping Genes in the Vibrionaceae family.
  
  -MLSA scheme used for the Vibrionaceae family.


#Installation
Dependencies: blastp, prodigal, vsearch (optional).

Make sure you download the repository in Home.

Test genome and expected results are in Test folder.


#Citation
Soon to be published. I hope.
